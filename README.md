# Amazon-SR
## A Chrome Extension which displays Customer satisfaction for each product on Amazon using Probability and statistics

This Extension uses Binomial distribution to find customer's probability of being satisfied with the product based on the average user rating and number of reviews.

Let's say there are two products one with 4.5 star, 100 reviews and other with 4 star rating, 10000 reviews. Which one would you buy(assuming all other factors like features, brand etc are similar)?. This is where the extension helps!

---
### When does it work best?
- When comparing two or more different sellers of the same product
- When comparing two different products with very similar features and you want to take judgement only based on previous customers experience
- When checking products which have very less number of reviews

As of now, It shows the Satisfaction Rate(SR) or also the probability of customer's satisfaction only on the amazon search page and the specific product pages.
